# Hand Tracking Volume Control

## Overview
This project uses **computer vision** and **hand tracking** to control the system volume based on hand gestures. By detecting the distance between the thumb and index finger, the system adjusts the volume in real-time.

## How it Works
The program uses **OpenCV** for video capture and **MediaPipe** for hand detection. A custom **Hand Tracking Module** is employed to locate hand landmarks. The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated, and the volume is adjusted accordingly:
- **Short distance** between fingers: Low volume.
- **Long distance**: High volume.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking with a webcam.
- Adjusts system volume using hand gestures.
- Visual feedback for hand position and volume level.
  
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-tracking-volume-control.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Ensure your webcam is working.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python volume_control.py
   ```
3. Use your thumb and index finger to control the volume.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## How to Use
1. Place your thumb and index finger in front of the camera.
2. As you move them closer or farther apart, the system volume will change.
3. Visual indicators will show the volume level on the screen.

## Hand Tracking Module
The **Hand Tracking Module** uses **MediaPipe** to detect hand landmarks and calculate the distance between the fingers, which is then mapped to the volume percentage.
